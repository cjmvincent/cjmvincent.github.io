        <p>
          My name is Charles. I live in good ole Savannah, Georgia where Spanish moss drapes our oaks and you can find the best darn pralines you'll ever have. I work for Bryan County Schools as the Mobile Device Administrator with aspirations of one day becoming an Automation Engineer. I am also currently dabbling in some front end web development which includes this webpage as my first ever project.

        </br></br>

          If you do not see me at work you can find me cruising the town on my longboard, or studioulsy lounged in my home office reading up on the next big technology attempting to incorporate it into my career. Other hobbies include building custom mechanical keyboards, cooking with my partner, binge watching Sci-Fi television shows, and jet setting to the latest country my best friend has moved to.

        </br></br>

          Feel free to use the links to the left to find my resume, projects I have worked on, or for the inquisitive minds, a way contact me.

        </p>

        <h3 id="Goodbye">
          See ya.
